# Lorebary DeepSeek 3.2 Proxy

A proxy server that connects Lorebary (or any OpenAI-compatible client) to NVIDIA NIM's DeepSeek 3.2 model. Features a web-based control panel for easy configuration.

## Features

- 🔄 Proxy compatibility - works with Lorebary and other proxies
- 🎛️ Web-based control panel for runtime configuration
- 🌊 Streaming support for real-time responses
- 🧠 Optional thinking/reasoning mode
- 📊 Request logging and monitoring

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v24 LTS)
- [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/) (for exposing localhost)
- [NVIDIA NIM API key] (get one from [NVIDIA](https://build.nvidia.com/))
- [Dotenv] (node has to already be installed before installing dotenv)
  
## Installation

1. Download the files or clone the repo

2. Install dependencies (the cmd has to be in the same directory as the other files):
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
NIM_API_KEY=your_nvidia_api_key_here
```

4. Move the cloudflared executable to the root folder, then rename it to "cloudflared.exe".

5. Install dotenv by running "npm i dotenv" in your command prommpt. 

## Usage

### Windows

1. **Start the proxy**:
   - Simply double-click `start-lorebary-proxy.bat`
   - A Cloudflare tunnel URL will appear in one of the cmd windows (e.g., `https://something.trycloudflare.com`)
   - Copy this URL to use in the proxy

2. **If you're using LoreBary**:
   - Open Lorebary custom proxy settings
   - Set target url to your Cloudflare URL (YOU NEED TO ADD /v1/chat/completions IN THE END OF THE URL)
   - Copy your custom lorebary url to janitor, put sommething random in the api key field, and put deepseek-reasoner in the model name

### Linux/Mac

1. **Start the proxy**:
```bash
npm start
```

2. **In a separate terminal, start Cloudflare tunnel**:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

3. Copy the generated URL and use it in Lorebary

 (I HAVEN'T TESTED IT IN LINUX/MAC YET)

## Control Panel

Access the web control panel at `http://localhost:3001` to configure:

- **Show Reasoning**: Display model's thinking process in `<think>` tags
- **Enable Thinking Mode**: Send thinking parameter to the model
- **Request Logging**: Log all requests to console
- **Streaming**: Enable/disable streaming responses
- **Max Tokens**: Set maximum response length (1-8192)
- **Temperature**: Adjust creativity level (0-1)

## Configuration

The proxy supports runtime configuration through the control panel. Settings are stored in memory and reset on restart.

Default settings:
```javascript
{
  showReasoning: false,
  enableThinking: false,
  logRequests: true,
  maxTokens: 4096,
  temperature: 0.7,
  streamingEnabled: true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "NIM_API_KEY environment variable not set"
- Make sure you created a `.env` file with your NVIDIA API key
- Restart the server after creating the `.env` file

### Port already in use
- The proxy uses ports 3000 and 3001
- Close any applications using these ports or edit `server.js` to use different ports

### Cloudflare tunnel not starting
- Make sure `cloudflared` is installed and in your PATH
- Download from: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/
